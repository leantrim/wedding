    "text":"We met for the first time in September 2021 at a nightclub in Barcelona. As you know, we love to enjoy the nightlife, and love arose without looking for it. We didn't talk much that night, but George appeared in my DMs on Instagram, however things didn't go much further. In December 2021 we were both invited to a friend's birthday party and casually we ran into each other again. That night our connection grew and we started hanging out more, but things were going nowhere. If you ask George, he tried very hard to capture my interest, but I was playing hard to get. If you ask me, he wasn't really doing anything to stand out. After a while things changed, we started dating more and fell in love, and soon after we moved in together. One year, a few trips, a grief and many celebrations and experiences later, in December 2022 in Paris, the city of love, he went down on one knee on a boat on the Seine (yes, super romantic), holding the most beautiful ring, asking me to marry him. It had never been easier for me to say YES before. Mixing our four different cultures, with very different previous experiences and lifestyles, it hasn't always been easy to agree on things, but we keep learning and our love continues to grow. Now, we can't wait to start our lives as husband and wife."
